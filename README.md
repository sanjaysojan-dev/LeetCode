> 1. Clone Git Hub Repo 
> 2. Create new local branch 
> 3. Switch to local branch 
> 4. Commit changes to local branch [add files, modify etc]
> 5. Push changes to local branch 
> 6. Merge from master
> 7. Switch to main branch 
> 8. Pull latest main changes 
> 9. Merge local branch to main [This would be a commit - should be done automatically when merging]

Look at the screenshot below to get an idea

As you can see I have created a new branch, did some work, whilst main was being updated. I then merged my branch into main. The main advantage 
of this is that you are independently working on your local branch with affecting the main branch. Once you know that everything works with your 
branch you can merge into Master. But you will have to make sure you pull all the changes in master first. This will become clear when you start
working on your own!! - Don't worry.
